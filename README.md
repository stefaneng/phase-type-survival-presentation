# Interacting Particle Systems and Phase-type distributions with Applications to Survival Analysis

This is a presentation for an interview with the UCLA Cancer Data Science Group.
It is based on my thesis "Phase-Type Distributions for Finite Interacting
Particle Systems" with more focus on the background and a connection to multi-state time-to-event models.
